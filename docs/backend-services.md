# Backend dependencies and architecture

The application is built as a single page web app that can run without its own dedicated backend. This is useful for
hosting it with a very simple, static host, like github pages. The server serves the static web content and the frontend
calls the [JW Player Delivery API](https://developer.jwplayer.com/jwplayer/docs) directly.
However, for additional functionality, the application can also connect to other backends to provide user
accounts / authentication, subscription management, and checkout flows. 


## Roles and Functions

The available backend integrations serve 3 main roles, Accounts, Subscription, and Checkout. Below are the methods
that any backend integration needs to support broken down by role:

- [Account](src/services/account.service.ts)
  - login
  - register
  - getPublisherConsents
  - getCustomerConsents
  - resetPassword
  - changePassword
  - updateCustomer

  - refreshToken
  - getLocales
  - getCaptureStatus
